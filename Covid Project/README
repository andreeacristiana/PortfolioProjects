Covid Data Project

This is a project where I explore, clean data and create dashboards (source below).

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The data that I used is from early 2020 to mid 2022.

My SQL queries use temp tables and views to show:
- Total Global Covid Cases vs population
- Percentages of Population Infected by Continent/Country
- Highest Death Count by Country
- Rolling Vaccinated Population vs Total Population by date
- Percentages of Population Vaccinated by Country
- Percentages of Population Infected
