# My Portfolio Projects

## **1. Covid Data Project**

This is a project where I do exploratory data analysis and create dashboards.

[source](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

The data used is from early 2020 to mid 2022.

My SQL queries use temp tables and views to show:
- Total Global Covid Cases vs population
- Percentages of Population Infected by Continent/Country
- Highest Death Count by Country
- Rolling Vaccinated Population vs Total Population by date
- Percentages of Population Vaccinated by Country
- Percentages of Population Infected

You can view my dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andreea5048/viz/CovidDashboardDesktop_16582200848410/Dashboard1)


## **2. Data Cleaning Project**

In this project, I use SQL to do data cleaning in a project about housing in Nashville.

The techniques used are:
- converting data types
- standardizing data formats
- populating null fields with data
- breaking one column into multiple columns using parsename and substring
- removing duplicates
- deleting columns
